## Monday
**Group Project**

[Insert Group Project Specs Here]

You should follow this [Group Project process](../resources/group_project_process.md) to get practice with the standard development team workflow.

Today, you will:

- meet with your client to get your project's requirements
- determine your team's working process
- write out and plan your user stories
- begin working on your features

Recommendations:

- Build the app as a monolith using react-rails to avoid the need for CORS
- If you are going to use Devise for authentication, skip building views in React

---

**Prep for tomorrow**

- Come up with ideas for Pitch Day
- Read if you can't come up with ideas: [YCombinator Request for Startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/)
