## Thursday
### Client Side Application Design

**Talks**

- New Technology Exploration Talks

**Daily Retros**

- How does design influence your development process?
- From your experiencing today designing and programming, what would you change in the future?

**Challenges**
  
- **Morning**
  
  **[Solo Project] IMDB Clone**
  
  Build an IMDB clone with React using the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). This should be an almost client side only application.
  
  In the Lil' Twitter challenge, a design was provided to you, which you componentized. In this project, you will focus on design -- specifically you will focus on UI and software design using React. Attention to detail is always important, but specifically for this challenge. You'll see why.
  
  This project, intentionally, has very little instructions. Artists and Software Developers are no different. [What is Art anyway?](http://panw.weebly.com/programming/what-is-art). To me, it's just an expression with an intent therefore making everything art. As a Software Developer, you will not always be provided with very clear specifications. As an artist, you use your imagination and ask questions.
  
  Have fun!
  
- **Afternoon (If you finish IMDB Clone)**
  
 Â **[Pair Project] Stack Overflow Clone**
  This project would be exactly the same from P2 - make sure to use polymorphic associations for comments and votes. To focus on realizing the benefit of React components, I would recommend getting to the comments and votes aspect ASAP, so consider skiping authentication.
