## Weekend

### Core

**Talks**

Choose a New Technology Exploration Talks and prepare your lightning talk.

For ideas see [Gemsy Talk Topic](../resources/gemsy_talk_topics.md)

**Solo Project**

Take this opportunity to start investigating what you will pitch for final project and the feasibility.

For example:
- If you are thinking of using the Google Maps API for a pitch build a small app that utilizes it.
- Perhpas you want to build a realtime chatting application checkout web sockets (Action Cable)

The app you build doesn't have to exactly to be your final project pitch, but something related. 

Satisfy that curious person that made you sign up to DBC in the first place who's been watching the last 7 weeks go by, picking up knowledge and power and wondering how to use it.

Build something, and then show us on **Monday morning**.
