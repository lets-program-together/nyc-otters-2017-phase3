## Friday
### Full Stack Application Design

#### Core

**Talks**

- New Technology Exploration Talks

**Daily Retros**

- What is a monolithic application? What are the benefits of a monolithic app verse a non-monolithic app?

**Challenge**

- **[Pair Project] Stackoverflow Clone**

  This project would be exactly the same from P2 - make sure to use polymorphic associations and make it better.

  The focus of this project is to better utilize React's compositional style and see some of the benefits first hand.
