# Final Projects

[Welcome to the Grind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbkZrOU1Zag)

Project pitches will occur first thing.  After pitches, you'll all vote on project preferences.  Your instructors will assign each of you to a final project group, trying to give everyone their first or second preferences.

The [Final Projects timeline](timeline.md) has been provided to you, and it is strongly recommended that you follow it. Not only to ensure that you have a great project at the end, but also so that you have a great set of learning experiences to talk about with employers.

### Tips

- Establish your team processes and guidelines first. This will set expectations within your team correctly.
- Use your instructors for opinions, philosophy and general advice, not implementation help or technical support. Make sure that you use them frequently though!
- If you're stuck on a technical issue, reach out to your team. If you're still stuck at the next cohort standup, bring it up and get some help from your instructors. (They'll help with code after standups, just not for adhoc questions.)

### Things to keep in mind for final projects
* Each team will have a unique situation, but please think about these high level areas for your team.
* A lot of decisions you make, will be experimental, so if you find that a process is not working try something new immediately.

### Pitfalls
  - **Team**
    - Doing all your associations in one go and hoping it works
    - Spending too much time trying to come up with the perfect design and implementation
    - Focusing on the wrong details (Read about bikeshedding: [Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), [Bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding))
    - Not effectively communicating and being in sync with your team and instructors
   
  - **Technical**
    - Not setting up a new Rails app properly ([see these instructions](https://gist.github.com/panw/1523e7289825583bfc45842d20914636))
    - Not having a .gitignore
    - Nesting Rails project in a subdirectory
    - Not committing after completing a task
    - Not being in sync with the master
    - Don't commit your AWS keys on Github
